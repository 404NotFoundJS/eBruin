## eBruin

eBruin is an online trading platform designed for UCLA students and faculty to buy and sell goods. The platform allows users to create an account, upload items they wish to sell, and browse listings to purchase items from other users. The application also includes features to facilitate communication between buyers and sellers, and to manage the status of orders.

## Development Environment Setup

To get started with the development environment for eBruin, follow these steps:

##Clone the repository from https://github.com/404NotFoundJS/eBruin.git
Navigate to the server directory and run npm install
Navigate to the client directory and run npm install
Return to the top-level eBruin directory and run npm install

## Server-Client Model and MERN Stack

eBruin is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, which is a popular web application architecture for building full-stack applications. In the MERN stack, the client-side user interface is built using React, while the server-side logic is implemented using Node.js and Express. The MongoDB database is used to store data related to users, items, and orders.

In the eBruin application, the server and client components communicate with each other through HTTP requests and responses. The server-side code is responsible for handling requests, performing database operations, and sending responses back to the client. The client-side code is responsible for rendering the user interface, handling user input, and sending requests to the server.

## Application Features

The eBruin application includes the following features:

User Sign Up and Login: Users can create a new account or log in to an existing account to access the platform.
Product Upload with Image: Users can upload a product image along with the product details for others to browse.
